Things left to do:

make trash a real trash pile (i.e. make it so you can see the last thing trashed, 
	maybe some indicator of how many things trashed?)

--make sure number of players entered is between 2 and 4 (maybe more later, 
	maybe solo mode) reprompt if not

-at game end, play again/start game with new players?

-do something intelligent if connection drops

add message box ("__ bought/revealed a __"/"___ shuffled deck") that always 
	shows the most recent message and shows more if you expand it

option to turn off tooltips/do it on right click instead of hover

visual display of deck/discard?  maybe include a count of deck?  
visual display of revealed/gained cards for other players?

work on the whole "inProgress"/DecisionCard/DecisionObject thing
	--implement more cards!!!!!


for later: store scores and rank people over time?
